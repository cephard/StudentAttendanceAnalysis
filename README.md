## 📌 Company: Riverside University
Riverside University is a growing institution committed to **academic excellence** and **student success**.  

Currently, student data (`courses`, `lecturers`, `departments`, `grades`, and `attendance`) is stored in **flat files**, making it difficult to:  
- 📉 Assess student performance effectively  
- 🔗 Link attendance with academic outcomes  
- 🧑‍🏫 Identify courses or lecturers that require additional support

## 🏆 Project Objective
To build a **normalized and optimized data model** in **Power BI**, enabling **interactive dashboards** for better decision-making across the university.
