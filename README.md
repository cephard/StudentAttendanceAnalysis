# StudentAttendanceAnalysis

## Company: Riverside University
Riverside University is a growing institution with a strong focus on
academic excellence and student success. The University tracks data on
students, courses, lecturers, departments, grades, and attendance.
However, the information is stored in a flat file, making it hard for
leadership to assess performance, link attendance to outcomes,
and identify courses or lecturers needing support.
The University aims to normalise and optimise this data in Power BI and

design a model able to deliver interactive dashboards for better decision-
making.
